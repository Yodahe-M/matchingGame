# Overview

In this project, I successfully implemented a matching game by following a tutorial on YouTube. 
The game features multiple emojis that players must match by clicking on small square boxes. 
Once a player successfully matches two emojis, those emojis remain flipped until the player completes the entire matching task.
Upon successfully matching all pairs, the game displays a congratulatory message.
